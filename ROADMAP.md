# RaplMail Roadmap

Living doc — add freely. Status: ✅ done · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ planned

## Shipped
- ✅ Local-first architecture: Python (FastAPI) backend + Tauri/Svelte desktop app, bundled sidecar
- ✅ Accounts: IMAP/SMTP, Gmail (OAuth), Microsoft 365 (OAuth device-code)
- ✅ One-field add-account with autodiscovery (MX / ISPDB / autoconfig / SRV) + pre-save connection test
- ✅ Encrypted credential vault (Argon2id + Fernet) + optional auto-unlock ("don't require password")
- ✅ Spark-style triage: `e` / swipe to done, "show done" with done indicator
- ✅ Rules engine + domain blocking, with live preview
- ✅ One-drag inline-image signatures
- ✅ Smart address book (auto-built from sent mail, junk-filtered)
- ✅ Unified inbox, foldable accounts, collapsible icon-rail sidebar, folder create/delete/drag-reorder
- ✅ Compose: rich-text toolbar, attachments, Ctrl+Enter, dock/window modes
- ✅ Undo-send (cancellable "Sending…" with countdown)
- ✅ MIME header decoding, body caching + warm IMAP connection pool, prefetch
- ✅ Sent-mail saved to Sent folder (IMAP APPEND)
- ✅ Typed search operators (`from:`, `to:`, `subject:`, `has:attachment`, `is:unread/done/flagged`) + FTS over body
- ✅ Smart category system (Primary / Newsletters / Social / Updates / Promotions) with tabs
- ✅ Smart remote-image blocking with blocked-URL details + Privacy toggle (idea #6)
- ✅ Signature manager: multiple signatures, per-account assignment, switch in composer, HTML (idea #11)
- ✅ Snippet expander: `;shortcut` → template with `{{first}}`/`{{email}}`/`{{date}}` (idea #10, #2 partial)
- ✅ Command palette (Ctrl+K): compose, jump-to-folder/category, sync, settings, actions
- ✅ In-app theme builder (Appearance settings): live color tokens + distinct presets (Dark/Light/Indigo), corner-roundness slider, and a custom-CSS escape hatch — all live + persisted
- ✅ Customize layout mode: a lockable toggle (🔧/🔓) that reveals drag-to-resize dividers for the sidebar and message-list columns; widths persist, locked by default so they aren't moved by accident
- ✅ Hand-drawn SVG icon set — every UI glyph routes through `lib/icons.js` (single source for the custom-SVG swap); no more hardcoded emoji
- ✅ Spark-style avatars: real sender logos via auto-fetched + locally-cached domain favicons (backend `/avatars/{domain}`, tries the domain directly then Google's favicon service), ring tinted by the receiving account's color, initials fallback, toggle in Appearance (privacy)
- ✅ Configurable quick actions: choose the two hover buttons on each message row (done/snooze/flag/read/archive/delete) and which buttons show under the recipient (reply/reply-all/forward/done/flag)
- ✅ Reader: added Forward + Reply All (Cc = everyone but you & the sender), Reply threads via In-Reply-To, Flag fixed (real styling + active state)
- ✅ Search whisperer: operator suggestions + live contact autocomplete; completed operators (`from:x`, `is:unread`, `/regex/`) render as removable chips
- ✅ Server-side settings: persisted to the DB file (survives installs), loaded on boot, debounced save; localStorage kept as fast cache
- ✅ Config export/import: download settings + rules + signatures + sender tags as JSON, import on another install (dev → prod); emails re-sync from the server
- ✅ Relative timestamps option ("3 hours ago" instead of a date) for list rows
- ✅ Reorderable special nav items (Smart Inbox, Snoozed, Calendar, …) via drag, order persisted
- ✅ Fixed: message list now orders by date in SQL before limiting (smart inbox was showing the oldest synced mail instead of newest)
- ✅ Settings search (filters the tabs by name + keywords) and editor-style theme presets (One Dark, Dracula, Monokai, Nord, Gruvbox, Solarized, Tokyo Night, GitHub Dark)
- ✅ Signature editor: Basic-text / HTML mode toggle + always-on live preview (rendered in a sandboxed iframe, images resolved) so you see exactly what recipients get
- ✅ Signature rendered inline in the compose body (Spark-style, editable), switchable live; body data: images convert to inline CID attachments on send so they always show
- ✅ Fixed: keyboard shortcuts no longer fire while composing / typing in a contenteditable (was marking the open mail done mid-type)
- ✅ Avatars preloaded into the browser cache so they don't pop in when returning to the inbox
- ✅ Reader: long recipient lists collapse to the first 3 + "N more" toggle; copy-address action; address menu closes on outside click
- ✅ Reclassifying a sender (mark as Newsletter/Notification…) moves the mail out of the main flow immediately (optimistic), not after the next sync
- ✅ Smart Inbox "Float by activity" placement: groups ride the recency timeline — a group rises to its newest mail, and newer standalone mail pushes it down
- ✅ Attachments: shown in a bar in the reader with size + one-click download (backend extracts metadata on body fetch; authenticated download endpoint); backfills for previously-opened mail
- ✅ Spark-style brand avatars: when a sender's own domain has no favicon, fall back to the most-prominent link domain in the email body (e.g. a no-reply@ mail that links your project site shows that site's logo); favicons cached locally, multi-source (direct + DuckDuckGo + Google)
- ✅ Custom-CSS reference (selector + variable cheatsheet in Appearance) + opt-in toggle to apply custom CSS inside email bodies
- ✅ Smart Inbox group placement: groups at top / after N newest messages / below all (separate from group order)
- ✅ Faster opens: body prefetch is now a single sequential queue (was 8 parallel fetches flooding the per-account IMAP lock); focused/hovered rows jump the queue so a click isn't stuck behind background prefetches
- ✅ Reader "show original" toggle: view any email with its own original colors/CSS (un-adapted) and back
- ✅ Desktop notifications for new mail (sender + subject preview from the sync engine), with on/off + "only when unfocused" settings and permission request
- ✅ Calendar (email-derived): parses meeting invites (text/calendar / .ics) into events, month grid + day agenda, "Sync invites" backfill scan, local RSVP (Yes/Maybe/No); backend `/calendar` API + `CalendarEvent` table
- ✅ Snooze: hide until a time, Snoozed view, auto-resurface (idea #9 partial, #3 partial)
- ✅ Multi-select + bulk actions (done / read / flag / snooze / archive / delete)
- ✅ Workspaces: group accounts, sidebar pills + `Ctrl+1..9` to switch context (idea #7)
- ✅ One-click unsubscribe via `List-Unsubscribe` (mailto + http)
- ✅ Zero-leak sandboxed HTML rendering: message body in an `<iframe>` with no scripts/same-origin (idea #8)
- ✅ Mute sender: auto-mark future mail from a sender done + clear existing (idea #3 partial)
- ✅ Screener: first-time senders held in a Screener view, approve→contacts / block→rule (idea #1)
- ✅ Send Later: schedule a send, background worker delivers it, Scheduled view + cancel
- ✅ Saved searches / smart folders (save any query, pinned in the sidebar)
- ✅ Newsletter feed: all newsletters stitched into one scrolling view (idea #1)
- ✅ Keyboard-shortcut cheatsheet overlay (`?`)
- ✅ Light theme + Auto day/night mode (theme presets)
- ✅ Paper Trail: dedicated receipts/invoices/orders view (idea #1)
- ✅ Follow-up reminders: sent mail with no reply in N days (idea #2)
- ✅ Per-account colors: editable color/name, colored stripe on rows in unified views
- ✅ Auto-BCC outgoing mail by recipient domain (idea #4)
- ✅ Regex search: `/pattern/` scans subject/from/snippet/body in the local DB (idea #4)
- ✅ Conversation threading: group by subject, full thread reader (toggle)
- ✅ Bundles: collapse 3+ notification messages from one sender into a card (idea #5)
- ✅ Offline action queue: archive/delete/send queue in SQLite, retried by a worker, status indicator (idea #9)
- ✅ IMAP IDLE: near-instant new-mail push per account (polling fallback)
- ✅ Polish: relative timestamps, loading skeletons, per-view empty states, keyboard scroll-into-view
- ✅ Open-next-on-done (Spark triage): marking the open/focused message done opens the next
- ✅ Smart Inbox: important mail in the main flow + chosen categories as group cards showing top-sender previews & live counts, sorted by recency (newest-active on top); per-category configurable; invitations/invitation-responses categories added
- ✅ Right-click context menu on messages: done, read/unread, flag, snooze, archive, delete, show-from-sender, mute, block, create rule, reclassify sender (learned)
- ✅ Smart Inbox tuning: configurable preview-sender count (with live preview), group order (recency or custom drag-order), and "mark sender as <category>" that sticks across syncs

## Planned (details for the brainstormed items in [potential_features.md](potential_features.md))

**Shipped recently**
- ✅ **Pinned mails** — pin messages to the top of the list (durable via MessageState, survives re-sync); pin/unpin in the right-click menu, pin marker on the row
- ✅ **Invitation categorization fix** — subject-prefix detection (meeting/schůzka/porada/…) + a real `text/calendar` event in the body recategorizes to Invitations / Invitation-responses on open
- ✅ **Notifications: test button + diagnosis** — "Send test notification" (bypasses the unfocused rule); clearer Windows/Focus-Assist guidance; fixed the icon
- ✅ **Text & UI size** — Appearance slider (80–140%) scales the whole UI via WebView zoom, persisted
- ✅ **Quiet hours / Do Not Disturb** — suppress notifications during a nightly window (handles past-midnight); toggle + start/end in Settings
- ✅ **Attachment reminder** — warns before send/schedule if the body mentions an attachment (EN+CZ) but none is attached

**Platform & distribution**
- ✅ **Auto-updater** — Tauri updater + process plugins wired; a signing keypair is generated (private key gitignored, public key baked into `tauri.conf.json`), `createUpdaterArtifacts` on, capabilities granted, and Settings → General → Updates has a **Check for updates** button that downloads + signature-verifies + self-installs + relaunches. `cargo check` + frontend build green. Activates once you publish a signed release `latest.json` (sign with `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` at build; endpoint set to the GitHub releases pattern — adjust org/repo)
- ✅ **Background / tray mode** — closing the window hides to a system-tray icon (IMAP IDLE + sync keep running); tray menu **Open RaplMail** / **Quit**, left-click reopens. Taskbar/dock **unread badge** + tray tooltip via a `set_unread_badge` command driven by inbox unread totals, and **Launch at login** (autostart plugin, toggle in Settings → General → Updates). Tauri `tray-icon`/`updater`/`process`/`autostart` plugins; `cargo check` + frontend build green (runtime tray/badge UX confirmed only when bundled)
- ✅ **macOS port** — the shell is cross-platform (tray/updater/autostart/dock-badge all work on macOS, mac `icon.icns` present, `run.py` honors `RAPLMAIL_HOST`), with a `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml` CI that builds the PyInstaller mac sidecar + `tauri build` → signed `.dmg`, and a pinned `backend/requirements.txt` for reproducible builds. OAuth (device-code/PKCE) and the encrypted-file vault are already platform-agnostic. (Produced by CI on a mac runner — can't be built on this Windows box; keychain-backed vault is a future nicety)

**AI & productivity (BYOK — keys in the vault, calls straight from the local backend)**
- ✅ Thread summarize, "Catch me up" & morning digest — a **Catch me up** button in the reader summarizes the whole thread (TL;DR + key points + action items); plus an opt-in **daily morning briefing** (Settings → General → AI assistant: toggle + delivery hour) that the sync engine generates once a day and pushes as a desktop notification + into the inbox assistant. BYOK Anthropic key, stored locally
- ✅ Draft & smart reply — reader **AI reply** button drafts a full reply from thread context (in your tone) + one-tap quick-reply chips; both open the composer prefilled and never auto-send
- ✅ AI priority scoring & inbox digest — command palette → **AI: catch me up on my inbox** opens an assistant with a prioritized "catch me up" briefing of unread mail (🔴/🟡/⚪) and a **Prioritize** tab scoring unread 0–100 with one-line reasons, each row clickable straight to the message

**Security & privacy**
- ✅ Encryption-at-rest for the local cache — opt-in (Settings → Encryption (PGP) → "Encrypt the local message cache"): cached `body_html`/`body_text` are sealed with a vault-held data-encryption key (Fernet) on write and transparently decrypted on read. Field-level so it can't corrupt the DB; FTS is indexed from plaintext in-memory so search still works. `app/core/atrest.py` + 4 unit tests green
- ✅ PGP (OpenPGP) — verify signed mail, decrypt encrypted mail, and sign/encrypt outgoing (inline PGP), using your own keys managed in Settings → Encryption (PGP). Reader shows a PGP shield badge (verified signer / decrypted-locally) next to the auth shield; compose has **Sign**/**Encrypt** toggles. Backend `app/sync/pgp.py` (pgpy), 4 round-trip unit tests green. (S/MIME + full PGP/MIME multipart construction still TODO — inline PGP + PGP/MIME detection covered)
- ✅ Lookalike / homoglyph & link-mismatch warnings — reader bar flags confusable/punycode sender domains, display-name domain mismatch, and link-text-vs-href mismatch

**Power-user & developer**
- ✅ Full-text search inside attachments — text/code/CSV/JSON and Office OOXML (.docx/.xlsx/.pptx, parsed via stdlib zip+xml, no deps) are extracted on message open and folded into the FTS index, so search matches words that appear only inside a file. PDF/legacy-binary formats still TODO (need a parser lib)
- ✅ Multiple identities / send-as aliases — manage per-account send-as identities in Settings → Accounts (Identities editor, plain address or `Name <addr>`); compose shows an identity dropdown next to the account when aliases exist; backend only honors a recognized identity and sets a correct envelope sender
- ✅ Mail merge / personalized bulk send — Command palette → "Mail merge": a subject/body template with `{{column}}` vars + a CSV (or one-address-per-line) recipient list → one individualized message per recipient (separate sends, no shared To/Cc), with a live preview and send progress
- ✅ Plus-address / alias generator with per-service tracking — Settings → Aliases & Tracking: generate a `you+service@domain` per site, then a scan of your mail lists every sub-address in use with message count, the senders hitting it, last-seen, a ⚠ leak flag when >1 sender uses one, and one-click **Mute** (auto-creates an archive rule for that alias)
- ✅ Per-account health dashboard — Settings → Accounts shows each account's live status dot (Connected/Syncing/Error/Idle), ⚡live IMAP-IDLE indicator, message + folder counts, last-sync relative time, last error, and a per-account "sync now" ↻ button (auto-refreshes every 5s)
- ✅ Collapse quoted replies ("Just the Diff" lite) — reader hides nested "On … wrote:" history behind a Show/Hide-quoted toggle (EN+CZ markers, blockquote/gmail_quote/Outlook dividers); setting in Appearance. Full git-diff rendering still TODO.
- ✅ Code-block syntax highlighting in the reader — language-agnostic highlighting of `<pre>` blocks (keywords/strings/comments/numbers), injected into the email iframe; toggle in Appearance (on by default)
- ✅ Local API — read-only `/metrics` (JSON) + `/metrics/prometheus` for dashboards/ESP32/Home-Assistant; opt-in (404 when off), authenticated by a stable API key (`X-API-Key`/`?key=`), configured in Settings → General → Local API. LAN access needs `RAPLMAIL_HOST=0.0.0.0`. (Outbound webhooks/push still TODO)
- ✅ Custom CLI — `backend/cli/raplmail_cli.py` (pure stdlib): `unread`, `search`, `accounts`, `metrics`, and `send` (body from `--body` or piped stdin, e.g. `make 2>&1 | raplmail-cli send -t me@x.com -s "build log"`). Points at the backend via `RAPLMAIL_URL`/`RAPLMAIL_TOKEN`

**Triage & UX polish**
- ✅ Universal undo for triage — Undo button on the toast for Done & Snooze (restores the message in place); archive/delete undo still TODO
- ✅ VIP senders & a Priority lane — mark a sender VIP (right-click row / reader sender-menu); their mail floats to the top with a ⭐ and always notifies, bypassing quiet hours + the focused-window rule
- ✅ Drafts autosave + restore — compose autosaves locally as you type and restores into a fresh blank compose; cleared on send/schedule. Plus a **Save draft** button that `APPEND`s to the IMAP Drafts folder for cross-device sync
- ✅ Keyboard chord shortcuts — `g` then i/s/c/f/n/p/t/a jumps to Inbox/Snoozed/Calendar/Follow-ups/Newsfeed/Paper-Trail/Scheduled/Settings (in the cheatsheet)
- ✅ Rich link unfurls in the reader — OpenGraph preview card for the main content link, fetched locally; off by default (toggle in Appearance)
- ✅ Templates / canned replies — full subject+body templates with `{{vars}}`, managed in Settings → Snippets & Templates, inserted from the compose **Templates ⌄** menu

**Larger / longer-horizon**
- ✅ Calendar / contacts integration (CalDAV/CardDAV) — Settings → General → "Calendar & contacts" holds a CalDAV/CardDAV URL + credentials and a **Sync now** that pulls VEVENTs into the calendar and vCards into the address book (stdlib `REPORT` client in `app/sync/caldav.py`, reuses the iCal parser; 3 parsing unit tests green). Read-only server→local for now; live sync verified against fixture responses (needs a real DAV server for end-to-end)
- ✅ Drafts: two-way IMAP `APPEND` to the Drafts folder — compose has a **Save draft** button that builds the MIME and `APPEND`s it (with `\Draft`) to the account's Drafts folder so it syncs across devices; re-saving expunges the prior copy (verified end-to-end against a live account)
- ✅ End-to-end API test harness — `pytest` suite (`backend/tests/`) boots the real app against a throwaway temp DB and exercises health, settings persistence, metrics opt-in + auth, AI graceful-degradation, plus-aliases, message listing, and attachment text extraction (13 tests, green). Live IMAP/SMTP variant against a real test account still TODO

### Reference playbooks (remaining, not yet built)

1. **Hey (Basecamp): Ruthless Inbox Defense**
   - ✅ The Screener: first-time senders held for approve/block — shipped.
   - ✅ The Newsletter Scroll: all newsletters stitched into one scrolling feed — shipped.
   - ✅ The Paper Trail: dedicated receipts/invoices/orders view — shipped.

2. **Superhuman: Absolute Speed**
   - ✅ Snippets with variables (`;intro` auto-fills recipient name) — shipped.
   - ✅ Instant Reminders: Follow-ups view surfaces sent mail with no reply in N days — shipped.

3. **Gmail / Outlook: Thread Management**
   - ✅ Mute sender — shipped (auto-done future mail).
   - ✅ **True thread mute** — shipped. Muting a conversation stores its thread key in a `MutedThread` table; new mail in that thread is auto-archived/done on arrival (whole reply-all chain), never hitting the inbox.
   - ✅ Snooze — shipped (basic).
   - ✅ **Presence-aware Smart Snooze** — shipped. "Snooze until I'm back" hides mail with no timer; a local idle-time monitor (Windows `GetLastInputInfo` via ctypes) detects when you return to the desk and instantly resurfaces it via a WebSocket push.

4. **Mailspring / Developer: Power Tools**
   - ✅ Local open-tracking — compose **Receipt** toggle embeds a 1×1 pixel served by the backend (`/track/o/{token}.png`); when the recipient's client loads it, the open is recorded and pushed as a live "📬 opened" notification. `OpenTrack` table + `/track` list endpoint. (Caveat: the recipient must be able to reach this backend — set `trackBaseUrl` to a reachable address; localhost-only won't register remote opens.)
   - ✅ Regex search over the local DB — shipped (`/pattern/`).
   - ✅ Auto-BCC outgoing mail by recipient domain — shipped.

5. **Shortwave: Bundle-Based Triage**
   - ✅ Collapse 3+ notifications from one sender into a "bundle card"; `e` archives the whole bundle — shipped.

9. **Mimestream: Offline Sync Action Queue**
   - ✅ UI updates instantly; archive/delete/send queue in SQLite; a background worker flushes to
     IMAP/SMTP and retries when the connection returns (⏳ N actions syncing) — shipped.

10. **Hardware Hacker: Local Extensibility**
   - ✅ Local API / Webhooks: read-only `/metrics` (+ Prometheus) endpoint — shipped (opt-in, API-key auth; see Power-user section).
   - ✅ Custom CLI tool: `raplmail-cli` (unread/search/accounts/metrics/send, stdin→draft) — shipped.

11. **Developer: Anti-Noise**
   - ✅ "Just the Diff" thread view: collapse-quoted replies — shipped (reader hides nested "On … wrote:" history behind a toggle; EN+CZ markers).
   - ✅ Code-block syntax highlighting: shipped (language-agnostic highlighting of `<pre>` blocks in the reader, toggle in Appearance).

12. **Trust No One: Local Security**
   - ✅ **Local DMARC/DKIM visualizer** — shipped. A red/green shield on the sender avatar: the backend reads the Authentication-Results stamped at your mailbox provider's trust boundary (full SPF/DKIM/DMARC w/ DNS) and surfaces pass (green) / fail (red, likely spoof). The reader shows the breakdown (DKIM/SPF/DMARC) and a "may be spoofed" banner — flagging spoofed `a123systems.eu` / RAPL mail before you read it.


----------------------

### 0.2.18 batch

- ✅ **Boot loading animation** — the blank "Starting RaplMail…" boot screen is now a proper animated splash (rotating accent ring around the mail glyph, shimmering wordmark, bouncing dots) shown while the Python sidecar warms up; honors reduced-motion. Pure frontend, gated on `!app.vault.ready`.
- ✅ **First-run onboarding** — a step-by-step welcome wizard (Welcome → Language → Theme → Preferences → Done) shown once on a fresh install (`onboarded` flag). Reuses the real theme presets (live preview), an EN/CZ language picker, and toggles for Smart Inbox / notifications / Start with Windows — every choice applies immediately and is persisted. Skippable; owns the keyboard while open so shortcuts don't leak to the list.
- ✅ **Smart Inbox is the default** — `smartInbox` now defaults on for new installs, and onboarding enables it explicitly, so the app opens straight into the grouped Smart Inbox instead of a flat list.
- ✅ **Localization (English + Čeština)** — a lightweight, dependency-free i18n (`lib/i18n.svelte.js` + `locales/en.js`/`cs.js`, reactive `t()` that live-switches with no reload, "Auto (system)" detection). Language picker in Settings → General and in onboarding. Primary UI chrome translated (nav/sidebar, settings shell + General, notifications, rules, command palette, mail list, reader, compose, onboarding, boot); remaining long-tail strings fall back to English and are being filled in progressively. The bilingual content-detection heuristics (quoted-reply / attachment / categorization) were already CZ-aware and stay as-is.
- ✅ **"Mute notifications" rule** — a new non-destructive rule action that delivers mail normally (still unread, still in the inbox) but suppresses the ding + popup. Matchable by sender address, sender domain, subject, recipient, **or smart category** (new `category` rule field → "mute notifications from newsletters"). Available in both rule editors and as a one-click "Mute notifications from sender" in the right-click menu. Distinct from "Mute sender" (which auto-marks done).
- ✅ **Empty-notification bug fixed** — root cause: the notification count summed *all* folders (Sent/Archive/Junk/custom, including copies synced from other devices) while the preview was inbox-only, so mail landing outside the inbox fired a titleless "New message" with no body and nothing new to see. The sync engine now counts only genuinely notify-worthy new **inbox** mail (unread, survived rules, not notification-muted) and emits it as a separate `notify` field; the frontend only fires when there's a real preview.
- ✅ **Start with Windows** — the autostart (launch-at-login) toggle is reconciled with the OS on every boot (reads the plugin's live `isEnabled` so the saved preference and the real registration can't silently drift), and is now also offered in onboarding. Setting lives in Settings → General → "Tray & startup".
- ✅ **Notification volume** — a 0–100 volume slider for the new-mail sound (Settings → General → Notifications); the Web-Audio tones scale to it, and the ▶ Play preview + the live "N new" ding respect it.

### 0.3.x

Shipped across **0.3.0** (bug fixes + link hygiene, git-diff, perf), **0.3.1** (multi-provider AI, inline first-run screener, webhook/script rule actions, Subscription Audit, safe-forward pixel stripping), **0.3.2** (Markdown compose + S/MIME crypto core & cert management), and **0.3.3** (sanitized `.eml` Safe Export + the full S/MIME pipeline — reader verify/decrypt and compose sign/encrypt). **Every item in this batch is now ✅** (PDF export intentionally left to the OS "Print to PDF").

**Bug fixes** — all shipped in 0.3.0
- ✅ **Signature encoding corruption (diacritics mangled on send)** — root cause was the outgoing `EmailMessage` using the default policy (`linesep='\n'`), so quoted-printable soft line breaks serialized as bare `=\n`; strict decoders then mis-parsed them, dropping the byte after each soft break ("Lukáš" → "Luká…=A1", "Republic" → "=epublic", `<span>` → `<=pan>`). Fixed by building the MIME with `email.policy.SMTP` (`\r\n`). Verified end-to-end: a Czech signature now round-trips intact.
- ✅ **Auto-select the "From" identity from the open mail** — composing while reading a message now defaults From to the account/alias the mail was addressed to (matched against each account's primary + aliases), instead of always the first account. Applies to blank compose and reply/forward.
- ✅ **Auto-insert the matching signature for the chosen From** — follows the corrected From: the selected account's default signature is inserted automatically and swaps when the From account changes.
- ✅ **Reply reflected in the reopened thread** — replies now reliably join their parent's conversation (the sync inherits the parent's `thread_id` via In-Reply-To instead of the fragile subject+participant discriminator), and the reader shows a **"View conversation"** banner — decoupled from the list-grouping setting so it works in Smart Inbox too — that live-refreshes when a sync lands, so a reply you just sent appears without reopening.
- ✅ **Smart group no longer jumps while its last unread is open** — opening the last unread of a smart group used to drop its `g.new` to 0 and make the card fall to the end of the day mid-read; the open message's category is now pinned to its hot position until you leave.

**Cryptographic armor & privacy shields**
- ✅ **Link hygiene & tracking-parameter stripper** (0.3.0) — every link in rendered mail is cleaned before it's clickable: `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, `mc_eid`, `mkt_tok`, HubSpot/Meta/Matomo params, etc. are stripped, and known redirect wrappers (Google `/url?q=`, Outlook SafeLinks, `l.facebook.com`, …) are unwrapped to the real destination, which is also shown on hover. On by default (privacy-first); "Show original" leaves links untouched.
- ✅ **S/MIME support (enterprise PKI)** — full pipeline, alongside OpenPGP, using `cryptography` 49 (pkcs7/pkcs12), no extra deps. **Crypto core** (`app/sync/smime.py`): detached sign, encrypt (enveloped-data), decrypt, inspect. **Cert management** (Settings → S/MIME): import your `.p12`/`.pfx` identity + store recipients' certs. **Incoming** (0.3.3): the reader detects a PKCS#7 part, verifies the signer (identity + cert validity) or decrypts with your key, and shows an S/MIME shield badge — fully guarded so it only ever fires on genuine S/MIME. **Outgoing** (0.3.3): **S/MIME sign / encrypt** toggles in the composer build a proper `multipart/signed` / `application/pkcs7-mime` message in the send path. Round-trip verified (sign→signer, encrypt→decrypt) through the real `build_mime` + 4 unit tests. (Full trust-chain verification of signatures is a future refinement — `cryptography` exposes decrypt but not a one-call verify, so the badge reports signer + validity.)
- ✅ **Sanitized "Safe Forward / Export" mode** — forwarding strips hidden 1×1 tracking pixels from the body by default (0.3.1). **0.3.3** adds sanitized **Export .eml** (reader → sender menu): the backend strips internal routing headers (`Received:`, `X-Originating-IP:`, `Authentication-Results:`, `X-MS-Exchange*`, …) and tracking pixels before download (`GET /messages/{id}/export?sanitize=true`, verified). PDF export is intentionally left to the OS "Print to PDF" (no heavy PDF dependency bundled).

**Developer & power-user ergonomics**
- ✅ **Git patch / diff renderer in the reader** (0.3.0) — `<pre>` blocks (and pasted plain-text patches) that look like a unified diff / `git` patch are auto-detected and rendered color-coded (added/removed/hunk/meta), building on the existing code highlighting.
- ✅ **Markdown compose mode** (0.3.2) — an **MD** toggle in the composer swaps the rich editor for a monospace Markdown pane; on send it compiles to clean inline-styled HTML (headings, bold/italic, inline + fenced code, links, lists, quotes, rules) with the plain-text alternative auto-derived. HTML-escaped (XSS-safe); signature + reply quote are re-attached. `lib/markdown.js`, 10 checks green.
- ✅ **Outbound webhooks & script actions in rules** (0.3.1) — two new rule actions: **POST to a webhook** (fires a JSON payload of the message to a local URL) and **Run a local script** (launches a user-authored command with the mail context in `RAPLMAIL_*` env vars — content passed via env, never interpolated into the shell). Both leave the mail fully delivered and still notify. (Attachment-save-to-folder is a natural follow-on for the script hook.)

**Workflow & inbox mastery**
- ✅ **Subscription Audit utility (new Settings → Utility tab)** (0.3.1) — a new Utility tab lists every mailing-list sender (List-Unsubscribe / newsletter) with total received, 30-day read rate, and last-seen (dormant/unread first), with one-click unsubscribe and one-click / batch **Auto-archive** (creates archive rules). Backend `/subscriptions/audit`.
- ✅ **First-run screener, inline in the reader** (0.3.1) — the reader now shows the "first-time sender — accept?" bar for any inbox mail from an unknown sender (not just inside the Screener view), driven by a computed `first_time_sender` flag on the message detail (same definition as the Screener list filter). Approve adds a contact; block creates a block rule.

**AI**
- ✅ **Multi-provider AI (beyond Claude)** (0.3.1) — Settings → General → AI assistant now has a provider selector (Anthropic / OpenAI / OpenAI-compatible + base URL) that branches the request build + response parse for the summarize / draft / prioritize / digest calls. OpenAI-compatible covers Groq, OpenRouter, Together, Ollama, LM Studio, etc.

**Performance & memory** — all shipped in 0.3.0
- ✅ **SQLite cache-size cap** — per-connection `PRAGMA cache_size=-10000` (≈10 MB) + `temp_store=MEMORY`, so idle pooled connections (one per account poller) don't each pin unbounded page cache.
- ✅ **IMAP socket-pool idle cleanup** — pooled connections idle past 10 min are closed (freeing socket + read buffers) instead of NOOP'd warm forever; the next fetch rebuilds on demand.
- ✅ **Revoke stale object URLs** — verified attachment blob URLs are already revoked (and in the desktop build attachments never create object URLs — they go through Rust to disk); avatars use HTTP-cached `Image().src`, not object URLs. Hardened the avatar warm-set so it can't grow unbounded over a marathon session.
